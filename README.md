My website used to show and track my progress in Software Development. Since I am still in the process of developing the website, I will be noting down my progress in this file

## Java
I started learning Java through the University of Helsinki's MOOC (Both [Part 1](http://moocfi.github.io/courses/2013/programming-part-1/) and [Part 2](http://moocfi.github.io/courses/2013/programming-part-2/)). This course has solidified my foundation in Object-Oriented Programming.

## Android
I have (only) made 2 Android applications so far, and obviously have a lot more to learn. However, these are some things that I noted to improve on based on the 2 applications:
* Themes/Styles/Layouts. I have been using the default themes and styles for both applications. I could probably learn to get a consistent theme throughout the application, as well as programatically generate layouts.
* Fragments. I have only used 1 Fragment so far, and could probably learn to use them more frequently for better UX.
* Resolve bugs and add improvements to the current applications. This includes "perfecting" the UX by standardizing animations etc.

### QuoteBook ([Link](https://github.com/nasjcodes/android-quotebook))
Quotebook is a basic Android application that loops through a list of quotes. I mostly followed [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2tpjep/the_new_step_by_step_guide_detailing_how_to_get/) reddit thread.

### Snake Mobile ([Link](https://github.com/nasjcodes/snake-mobile))
To better understand the interactions and functions of Android compared to Java, I decided to port the [Worm Game](https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/part2/week-12/) (Exercise 49) from the University of Helsinki's MOOC.

## Web
To build a strong foundation in understand web programming, I decided to look at various resources following [Andrei Neagoie's](https://hackernoon.com/learn-to-code-in-2018-get-hired-and-have-fun-along-the-way-b338247eed6a) "guide". This included the well known [CS50 Course from Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y62zj9ozPOM&list=PLhQjrBD2T3828ZVcVzEIhsHVgjANGZveu). I plan to continue using Andrei Neagoie's guide.
